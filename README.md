# Gesture Recognition using TF Lite

This project focuses on gesture recognition using accelerometer and gyroscope data. The dataset comprises gestures such as 'down_to_up' and 'forward_clockwise'. After preprocessing, including normalization and splitting into training and testing sets, a deep learning model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of dense layers with ReLU activation. Following training and evaluation, the model is converted to TensorFlow Lite, facilitating deployment on resource-constrained devices while maintaining high accuracy.
